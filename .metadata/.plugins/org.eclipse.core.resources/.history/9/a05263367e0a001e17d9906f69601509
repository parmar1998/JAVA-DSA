                                              		MAVEN INTRO
-> maven is building automation tool.
-> automates the build process
-> maven is now embedded.
                                                   WHY DO WE NEED IT.
-> it provides a common folder structure.(uniform project Structure)
-> provides to manage dependency.
-> provides a tomcat server 
-> provides a way so that JAR can be shared across project.
                                                  CHALLENGES BEFORE MAVEN
-> project structure will not be uniform
-> few dependencies are needed at runtime and some at compile time.,so developer will have to take care of all this.
-> Transitive dependencies - inter-related dependencies.
-> Duplicate dependencies - redundancy
-> Version problem 
                                                    USES SOLUTION        
-> maven is evolved build process in jakarta turbine project
													MAVEN ARCHETYPES
-> Template - appropriate directory structure
-> initial set of dependencies
-> meta data that is provided for project build
-> group id - organisation
-> artifact id - project name
-> version - v of project	
													POM FILE
-> Project Object Model - config file - declarative descriptor 		
													MAVEN REPOSITORIES
