                                               		MAVEN INTRO
-> maven is building automation tool.
-> automates the build process
-> maven is now embedded.
 
                                                   WHY DO WE NEED IT.
-> it provides a common folder structure.
-> provides to manage dependency.
-> provides a tomcat server 
-> provides a way so that JAR can be shared across project.
 
                                               CHALLENGES BEFORE MAVEN
-> project structure will not be uniform
-> few dependencies are needed at runtime and some at compile time.,so developer will have to take care of all this.
-> Transitive dependencies - inter-related dependencies.
-> Duplicate dependencies - redundancy
-> Version problem
