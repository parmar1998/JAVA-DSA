Take input & store Edges

/*
	 We often need to compare two values in our Java programs.
		 Comparing primitive values like int, char, float is very easy and can 
		 be done with comparison operators like <, >, == etc.
		But comparing objects is a little different. For example,
		 how would you compare two Employees? how would you compare two Students?
		You need to explicitly define how the objects of user defined classes 
		should be compared. For this purpose, Java provides two interfaces called Comparable and Comparator.
		Once you define how the objects should be compared using any of these interfaces, 
		youâ€™ll be able to sort them using various library functions like Collections.sort or Arrays.sort.
