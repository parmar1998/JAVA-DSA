Backtracking name itself suggests that we are going back and coming forward; if it satisfies the condition, 
then return success, else we go back again. It is used to solve a problem in which a sequence of objects is chosen 
from a specified set so that the sequence satisfies some criteria.

Recursion is a technique that calls the same function again and again until you reach the base case. 
Backtracking is an algorithm that finds all the possible solutions and selects the desired solution from the given set of solutions.
